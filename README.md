# Blade Blade 2

# Plot

You're a witch disgruntled with the socioeconomic aspects of Christmas, and
you're holding the Elves responsible. Storm their Fir Tree, get as high as you
can while killing all who stand in your way using your trusty Blade Blade.

# Gameplay Hints

- Cold damage can freeze enemies, causing them to stop moving or attacking.
- Fire damage can ignite enemies, dealing damage over time.
- Lightning damage can shock enemies, making them take more damage.
- Breaking a crystal empowers crystals of other colors, making them drop more rare rings.
- Different rings have different affixes. E.g. blue rings have armor and red rings have life.
- If you fall off the edge, the level is reset, but the crystal colors remain the
  same... optimise your route through the level to maximize your rewards!

# Building instructions

1. Install Allegro 5.
2. Install Rust from rust-lang.org. You'll need the nightly version.
3. Run `cargo run --release` to build and run the game.

On Windows, you can use the pre-built binaries (extracted in the `allegro`
subdirectory). `run_msys.sh` may be useful for this purpose.
