- Keep collecting stuff, lose it all on death... risk vs reward?
    - But death feels bad, need to cap it somehow? Maybe lose it all on floor transition?
    - Reuse the rampage?
- Get gear slots, different types (gems?), type controls affixes, movement direction controls what types drop (not sure that makes sense, maybe differently colored portals, chests which explode other colors... like harvest)?
    - I like this last idea. Have different chest with crop rotation mechanics, just need to double check that it works with more than 3 colors... maybe it can be done with 4?
    - I need to figure out how to do drops in a way that doesn't impede gameplay


3 types of boxes (or monster colors?)
rampage builds impact on box opening (maybe have an option to destroy or open a box?)
pause on inventory

Doesn't feel quite right...

I definitely want rampage
I definitely want some way to select loot
Maybe collect loot on level change?

I really don't want to do 3 different monster types.
But also don't want to have a weird interaction with the chests or w/e.

Maybe like... the fonts collect enemy souls, and you can break open the chest to collect loot, and add to the counter of the other two (draining the current counter). Limit changed by level? Rampage just makes things faster.
